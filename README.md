# CoffeeBot 2.0

Keeps track of which coffee machines that are available at [work](https://payex.com). Version 2 is written in Kotlin for the fun of it.


## What happened to v1?

Version 1 is based on node.js and Slack's RTM API. Because of various issues with the RTM API (timeouts, disconnects) v1 is deprecated. The source code can be found in the `v1` branch or `v1.0` tag.
